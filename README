To use the gVoiceMigrator script:

1.  Export your google My Contacts list as a CSV
2.  Filter out anyone without a mobile number
3.  *Optional:* Cross reference your google contacts with a list of your Facebook friends: Copy the full text of each page of friends, and pasting it consecutively into a text file. (All the extra noise doesn't matter, as long as you get the names.) Replace new lines with a space. Paste it into any cell and use your spreadsheet program's search / lookup function to check if each name can be found in your list of Facebook friends' names. Delete anyone that isn't. 
4.  Delete anyone you don't want to send your new number to.
5.  Delete all columns except first name and phone number
6.  Save as ./numbers.csv
7.  Run send_smss.py
8.  Enter your google voice email and password
9.  Let it run, texts are being delivered.
